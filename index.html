                <h2>4. RWA-Backed NFT Ownership</h2>
                <h3>4.1 Minting and Acquisition</h3>
                <p>When you mint or purchase a CANA RWA-Backed NFT, you receive a digital NFT stored in your blockchain wallet, representing ownership of a specific physical product. The NFT serves as proof of ownership and authenticity of the corresponding physical product. You also receive a physical product delivered to your specified address. Each physical product contains a unique QR code that links to the NFT's blockchain record. The minting or purchase price includes the cost of the physical product, delivery, and all applicable blockchain transaction fees.</p>
                
                <h3>4.2 Ownership Rights</h3>
                <p>Ownership of a CANA RWA-Backed NFT grants you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full ownership of the specific physical product represented by the NFT</li>
                    <li>The right to use, display, and enjoy the physical product for personal, non-commercial purposes</li>
                    <li>The right to resell the NFT through the CANA Marketplace, subject to the Destruction Protocol outlined in Section 5</li>
                    <li>The right to access exclusive community benefits as outlined in Section 8</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ownership does not grant you any intellectual property rights in the CANA brand, designs, or technology.</p>
                
                <h3>4.3 Product Delivery</h3>
                <p>CANA will make reasonable efforts to deliver the physical product to the address provided during the minting or purchase process within a reasonable timeframe. You are responsible for providing accurate delivery information. CANA is not responsible for delivery failures resulting from incorrect or incomplete delivery information. Risk of loss and title for the physical product pass to you upon delivery to the carrier.</p>

                <h2>5. One-of-One Protocol: Destruction Before Resale</h2>
                <h3>5.1 Destruction Requirement</h3>
                <p>Before reselling any CANA NFT on the Marketplace, you must permanently destroy the corresponding physical product. This ensures that no two people ever own the same physical item, maintaining the rarity and integrity of the NFT.</p>
                
                <h3>5.2 Destruction Verification</h3>
                <p>To verify destruction, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Record a clear video showing the complete destruction of the physical product, ensuring the QR code is visible in the video.</li>
                    <li>Submit the video through the CANA Marketplace for verification.</li>
                    <li>Wait for confirmation that the destruction has been verified before proceeding with the resale.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>5.3 Verification Standards</h3>
                <p>Destruction verification videos must meet the following standards:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The entire product must be clearly visible throughout the video.</li>
                    <li>The QR code must be clearly visible at the beginning of the video.</li>
                    <li>The destruction must be complete and irreversible.</li>
                    <li>The video must be continuous, without cuts or edits.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>CANA reserves the right to reject verification videos that do not meet these standards.</p>
                
                <h3>5.4 Prohibited Actions</h3>
                <p>The following actions are strictly prohibited:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selling or transferring the physical product separately from the NFT.</li>
                    <li>Creating or distributing replicas or counterfeits of CANA products.</li>
                    <li>Submitting fraudulent destruction verification videos.</li>
                    <li>Attempting to resell an NFT without completing the Destruction Protocol.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Violation of these prohibitions may result in account suspension, NFT invalidation, and potential legal action.</p>
